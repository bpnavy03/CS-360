# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
#
# This app was a weight-tracking app that helped users track their daily weights to achieve their desired weight goal.
# The user needs were to be able to input, view, and track their dailly weights and to receive a notification when the achieve their goal.
#
# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
#
# Several screens and features were required for the developmed of this app. A log-in screen, a weight history screen that was in a grid-like format, and a weight entry screen.
# These screens and features allowed users to fully interact with the app to achieve their weight goal.
# Lastly, a notification would be sent to the user to notify them that they met their weight goal.
# Keeping those screens and features in mind, the UI had to conform to Android's app development guidelines and be user-friendly and captivate their attention.

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied to the future?
#
# My approach to the coding revolved around understanding the user needs and the intent of the app. With that in mind, I developed the UI first ensuring it met all design requirements.
# After the UI was finished, I moved on to coding the functions for the UI to ensure that the app worked as designed. These strategies are useful for any programmer, regardless of app development.
#
# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
#
# I tested my code in Android Studio using an emulator. This enabled me to access the app on a device to see how it would respond at run-time. This allowed me to troubleshoot issues further.
# This step is important to ensure app functionality.
#
# Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
#
# I had to innovate during the UI development. I have never developed an app before, so everything was new to me regarding UI and Android Studio.
#
# In what specific component of your mobile app were your particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
#
# The UI was definitely my weakest component. My strongest component was the Java programming to allow for my UI to function correctly.
